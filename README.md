# Custom-Dev-Fee-Token

It doesn't work *that* great rn..it takes a part of the token bought/sold then swaps for the WETH on that chain.

gonna have to figure how to intercept input token and send instead of doing it again and wasting gas

This is a modified version of a "babytoken" from pinksale so maybe that's why it doesnt work great
